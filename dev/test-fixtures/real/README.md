# Real Test Fixtures

Place real DS analyses here for testing. These files are NOT committed to git
(add *.md to .gitignore in this directory if needed) as they may contain
sensitive company data.

## How to Add
1. Export from Confluence or copy your .md file here
2. Note: target audience, workflow context, and any known issues
3. Run the review and compare against your expectations
