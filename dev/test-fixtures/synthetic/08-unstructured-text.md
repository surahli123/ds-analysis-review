We've been looking at how our customer base segments out based on purchasing behavior, and after spending a few weeks on this I want to share what we found and what I think it means for how we allocate marketing spend and product development resources going into 2026 planning. The short version is that our customers cluster into four distinct behavioral groups, and we're currently over-investing in the largest segment while under-serving the most profitable one, which I think explains some of the margin pressure we've been seeing.

Let me start with the data. We pulled 18 months of transactional data from the warehouse, covering January 2024 through June 2025. The dataset includes 2.4 million unique customers who made at least one purchase in that window, along with their full purchase histories, browsing sessions tied via user ID, support interactions, and marketing touchpoints from our attribution system. We excluded B2B accounts (identified by company billing addresses and order sizes above $2,000) because their purchasing dynamics are fundamentally different and would distort the segmentation. We also excluded customers who only made a single purchase of less than $15, as these are predominantly one-time coupon users from our acquisition campaigns and don't represent organic behavior. After these exclusions, the working dataset was 1.87 million customers.

For the segmentation methodology, we used a combination of RFM features (recency, frequency, monetary value) augmented with behavioral signals from browsing data. Specifically, we engineered 12 features: days since last purchase, purchase frequency (orders per month), average order value, total lifetime revenue, number of distinct product categories purchased, average browsing sessions between purchases, average session duration, proportion of sessions that included search, support ticket rate per order, return rate, proportion of purchases made on mobile, and email engagement rate (opens plus clicks divided by emails sent). All features were standardized to zero mean and unit variance before clustering. We used k-means clustering because it's interpretable and fast enough to run on the full dataset without sampling, which was important since I wanted to avoid introducing sampling noise when the segments are intended to inform budget decisions. We tested k values from 2 to 8 and selected k=4 based on the elbow method and silhouette scores. The silhouette score at k=4 was 0.41, which is moderate but reasonable for customer behavioral data where segments naturally overlap. At k=3 the silhouette was 0.44 but one cluster was clearly two distinct populations when we examined it qualitatively, and at k=5 the fifth cluster was too small (2.3% of customers) to be operationally useful.

The four segments that emerged are what I'm calling Power Shoppers, Steady Eddies, Bargain Hunters, and Drifters. Let me walk through each one because the differences are stark and the implications are significant.

Power Shoppers make up about 8% of the customer base (roughly 150K customers) but account for 34% of total revenue. These are customers with high frequency (averaging 2.8 orders per month), high AOV ($189 average), and high engagement across channels. They browse frequently between purchases (averaging 6.2 sessions per week), use search heavily (72% of their sessions include search), and have the highest email engagement rate (41% open rate). Their return rate is moderate (8.2%) and their support ticket rate is actually the lowest of any segment (0.04 per order), suggesting they're experienced with the platform and rarely need help. They shop across an average of 5.1 product categories, which means they see us as a primary shopping destination rather than a specialist retailer. Retention is excellent — 91% of Power Shoppers active in H1 2024 were still active in H1 2025.

Steady Eddies are the largest segment at 35% of the base (654K customers) and contribute 38% of revenue. They purchase regularly but at lower intensity than Power Shoppers — about 1.1 orders per month with an AOV of $152. Their engagement is moderate and predictable. They browse 2-3 times per week, use search in about 45% of sessions, and have a 28% email open rate. What defines this group is consistency: their month-to-month purchase variance is the lowest of any segment (coefficient of variation 0.31 vs. 0.52 for Power Shoppers). They shop across 3.2 categories on average. Return rate is 6.1% and support tickets are 0.06 per order. Retention is solid at 78% year-over-year. This is the backbone of the business — reliable, low-maintenance, and collectively large enough to be the plurality of revenue.

Bargain Hunters represent 22% of the customer base (411K customers) but only 14% of revenue. Their purchasing behavior is highly episodic and promotion-driven. Average purchase frequency is 0.4 orders per month, but this masks extreme variance — they tend to buy in bursts during sales events and go dormant between them. Their AOV is $98, the lowest of any segment, and 63% of their purchases include at least one item that was on sale or had a coupon applied (compared to 31% for Steady Eddies and 22% for Power Shoppers). Email engagement is interesting: their open rate (33%) is actually higher than Steady Eddies, but their engagement is concentrated on promotional emails (48% open rate on sale announcements vs. 12% on product recommendations or content). They browse infrequently between purchases (0.8 sessions per week on average) and use search less (34% of sessions). Return rate is the highest at 11.3%, and support tickets are 0.09 per order, also the highest. Retention is mediocre at 52% year-over-year, and when they do churn, exit surveys most commonly cite "found better prices elsewhere" (34% of responses). This segment is expensive to serve relative to revenue generated, and our current marketing spend is disproportionately allocated to them because our promotional campaigns (which represent 42% of total marketing budget) primarily reach and activate this group.

Drifters are the remaining 35% of the base (662K customers) and contribute 14% of revenue. These are customers who made a few purchases, never developed a regular pattern, and are at high risk of churning or have already effectively churned. Purchase frequency is 0.2 orders per month, AOV is $118, and they shop in only 1.8 categories on average. Engagement is low across the board — 1.2 browsing sessions per week, 22% search usage, 19% email open rate. Year-over-year retention is only 31%. What's notable about this group is that many of them (an estimated 40-45% based on their early purchase patterns) looked like they could have become Steady Eddies but were lost in the first 90 days. When we look at the purchase timing of Drifters who eventually churned, there's a clear pattern: they make their first purchase, don't receive a compelling reason to come back within 30 days, and the probability of a second purchase drops below 10% after 60 days of inactivity. This suggests a significant retention intervention opportunity in the early lifecycle.

Now for the part that matters most for planning. When we look at how our current marketing budget maps to these segments, the misalignment becomes clear. We spend approximately $8.9M per quarter on marketing. Of that, roughly $3.7M goes to promotional campaigns (flash sales, coupon distributions, seasonal sales) that disproportionately activate Bargain Hunters. Another $2.1M goes to acquisition, which is feeding all segments roughly proportionally but is not differentiated by predicted segment membership. About $1.8M goes to retention and lifecycle marketing, which is currently one-size-fits-all across segments. And $1.3M goes to brand and content marketing.

The core problem is that we're spending 42% of our marketing budget on promotional campaigns that primarily serve Bargain Hunters (14% of revenue, 52% retention, highest return rate), while Power Shoppers (34% of revenue, 91% retention, lowest support cost) receive no differentiated treatment. Power Shoppers don't need discounts to buy — they're buying at full price 78% of the time. What they respond to, based on our email engagement data and a small survey we ran in May (n=342 Power Shopper respondents), is early access to new products, personalized recommendations, and loyalty recognition. We're not giving them any of that in a systematic way.

Meanwhile, the Drifter segment represents a massive leaky bucket. We spend acquisition dollars to bring them in, they make one or two purchases, and then we lose them. If we could convert even 15% of Drifters into Steady Eddies through targeted early-lifecycle engagement, the revenue impact would be substantial. A Drifter who becomes a Steady Eddie goes from roughly $26/year to $168/year in revenue — a 6.5x increase per converted customer. At 15% conversion of the 662K Drifter pool, that's approximately 99K new Steady Eddies generating an incremental $14.1M in annual revenue, minus whatever we spend on the intervention program.

I should note some limitations of this analysis. The k-means approach assumes roughly spherical clusters in feature space, which is a simplification — customer behavior is messy and some customers genuinely sit between segments. We validated by running a Gaussian Mixture Model on the same data and got broadly similar groupings, though the GMM assigned about 12% of customers with posterior probabilities below 0.6, meaning they don't cleanly belong to any one segment. We're treating them as belonging to their most likely segment for simplicity, but any intervention design should account for boundary cases. Also, the RFM-plus-behavioral feature set doesn't include any psychographic or demographic data — we know what customers do, not why they do it. Adding demographic overlays from our data provider could sharpen the segments, and I'd want to do that before we design specific campaigns. The 18-month window is also a choice — some seasonal shoppers who buy only during holidays might be misclassified as Drifters if their pattern doesn't fully appear in the window. Extending to 24 months when we have the data available would help address this.

Another caveat is that the causal claims about marketing spend effectiveness are suggestive, not definitive. We're observing that Bargain Hunters are the primary respondents to promotional campaigns, but we haven't run an experiment where we withhold promotions to measure the true incremental effect. It's possible that some Bargain Hunter purchases would happen at full price in the absence of promotions — we just don't know the counterfactual. Before reallocating significant budget away from promotions, I'd recommend running a holdout test where we suppress promotional emails for a random 10% of Bargain Hunters for one quarter and measure the revenue impact. If the revenue drop is less than the promotional cost, the reallocation math works. If not, we need a more nuanced approach.

The segmentation stability over time is something to keep an eye on as well. I ran the clustering on H1 2024 data alone and compared segment assignments to the full 18-month model. About 73% of customers were assigned to the same segment in both runs, which is decent stability but means roughly a quarter of customers shift segments over time. Practically, this means segment-specific programs should be re-evaluated quarterly, and any CRM tagging should be refreshed at least that often.

Looking at competitive context, the customer segmentation patterns we're seeing are consistent with what's been documented in marketplace businesses at our scale. The 80/20 dynamic (our top 43% of customers by segment — Power Shoppers plus Steady Eddies — generating 72% of revenue) is slightly less concentrated than the typical marketplace pattern, which suggests we have room to grow wallet share among our best customers. The Bargain Hunter segment, at 22% of the base, is larger than what I've seen reported at comparable marketplaces (typically 12-16%), which may reflect our historically aggressive promotional strategy creating learned price sensitivity among a portion of the base. This is worth investigating further — are we creating Bargain Hunters through our own marketing behavior?

In terms of what I'd recommend as next steps, there are three immediate actions. First, design and launch a Power Shopper loyalty program pilot — even something simple like early access to new arrivals and a dedicated support line. The investment is low and the upside in retention and share-of-wallet is significant for a group that already loves us. Second, build a Drifter early-lifecycle intervention: an automated sequence in the first 90 days post-first-purchase that uses behavioral triggers (no second browse within 14 days, no second purchase within 30 days) to deliver targeted re-engagement. Third, run the Bargain Hunter promotional holdout test I described above to quantify the true incremental value of our promotional spend before making any major budget reallocation.

The broader implication for 2026 planning is that we should shift from a one-size-fits-all marketing budget to a segment-aware allocation model. This doesn't require a massive technology investment — our CRM can already segment on most of the features I used, and the cluster assignments can be refreshed monthly with a scheduled pipeline. The bigger change is organizational: marketing needs to own segment-specific KPIs rather than aggregate metrics, and we need to agree on what success looks like for each segment. Power Shopper success is retention and wallet share. Steady Eddie success is consistency and gentle upsell. Bargain Hunter success is margin improvement (not volume). Drifter success is conversion to Steady Eddie within 90 days. Once we align on those segment-specific objectives, the budget allocation conversation becomes much more straightforward.
